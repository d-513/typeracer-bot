# typeracer bot

a simple puppeteer experiment to make a bot for typeracer

## running

`node index.js`  
you can select the amount of bot to use. I recommend using just one

## seeing the bot

by default it just prints messages to terminal  
if you want to see what the bot is doing edit `headless: true` to `headless: false` in bot.js
